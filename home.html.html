   <p class="mb-4">A Saturday night, Aria got a text from her boyfriend. Just six words, sitting quietly on her screen: <q>Can we talk? It’s important.</q></p>
   <p class="mb-4">Her heart didn’t race — it dropped. She stared at the message for a long moment, already knowing that nothing good ever started with those words. Outside, the city buzzed with weekend laughter, but inside her apartment, everything felt too still. She typed <q>Sure.</q> then deleted it. Typed <q>What’s wrong?</q> then deleted that too.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Finally, she left him on read — like silence might protect her from what was coming.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Needing a distraction, she headed to the bar to grab drinks for her and her mates. <q>Hey, three tequilas, please,</q> she said, trying to sound casual.</p>
   <p class="mb-4"><q>Yeah, no worries — coming right up,</q> the bartender replied.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">As she waited, her thoughts returned to the text. It echoed in her head like a warning bell. She stood there, numb, confused, fingers tapping lightly against the bar top. Her brain began to spiral — Did I do something? Is he okay? Is he breaking up with me?</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Then she caught herself. Stop overthinking, she told herself. It might be something else. Maybe it’s nothing.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">But deep down, she knew. No one says <q>It’s important</q> unless it is.</p>
   <p class="mb-4"><q>Here are your three tequilas,</q> the bartender said, sliding the glasses across the bar.</p>
   <p class="mb-4"><q>Thank you,</q> Aria replied softly.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">She took the drinks in both hands and walked back to her friends like nothing had happened — like her chest wasn’t tight, like her mind wasn’t a storm of questions she couldn’t silence.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">The music pulsed, laughter rose around her, and someone bumped into her shoulder with a clumsy <q>Cheers!</q> But Aria just smiled, nodding along, the same way she always did.</p>
   <p>The smile wasn’t real.<br/>It never really was.</p>

  <div id="thirdPageText" class="hidden max-w-xl mx-auto text-left text-white text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed px-4 sm:px-0 overflow-y-auto max-h-[80vh]">
   <p class="mb-4">After a long night out with her mates, Aria said her goodbyes and stepped out into the cool night air. The streets were quieter now, a breeze brushing past her as if the world already knew what was coming.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">She stared at her phone for a moment before finally tapping his name and hitting call. The ringing felt louder than it should.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">“Hey,” she said when he picked up. Her voice was soft, unsure. “Uhm… you said you wanted to talk?”</p>
   <p class="mb-4">A pause. Then, without hesitation:</p>
   <p class="mb-4">“Yeah. I… I want to break up.”</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Aria stopped walking. Just like that, the night stilled.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">“Oh,” she said, barely above a whisper.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">“I’m sorry,” he continued, his voice flat. “This just… isn’t working out.”</p>
   <p class="mb-4">“Yeah. Yeah, no — you’re right,” she replied, swallowing the lump in her throat.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">“Goodbye, Aria. Take care.”</p>
   <p class="mb-4">The call ended before she could say anything else. Just a cold silence where warmth used to be.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="fourthPageText" class="hidden max-w-xl mx-auto text-left text-white text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed px-4 sm:px-0 overflow-y-auto max-h-[80vh]">
   <p class="mb-4">She stood there as the rain began to fall — soft at first, then heavier, like the sky was mourning with her.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Tears slipped down her face, warm against the cold drops. She didn’t wipe them away. Didn’t move. Just stood still as the world blurred around her.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Eventually, she began walking, slowly, aimlessly, her clothes soaked and heavy. Streetlights shimmered through the rain, painting the pavement gold and lonely.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">When she reached her apartment, she fumbled for her keys. Her hands were shaking too much. The metal kept missing the lock. Her vision swam.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Her chest was tight, her head spinning, her heart breaking in absolute silence.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">She finally got the door open, stepped inside, and let it quietly shut behind her — like the last page of a chapter she never wanted to end.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">She closed the door behind her and turned, pressing her back against it like it was the only thing holding her up.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Then she slid down slowly, the weight of it all too much to carry anymore.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Knees to her chest, arms wrapped tightly around them, she let the sobs come — heavy, broken, unstoppable.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">The kind of crying that doesn’t ask for comfort. The kind that just needs to exist.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">And that’s what she did. She cried.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">All night.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Until the morning light crawled through the blinds and found her still there, eyes swollen, voice gone, heart shattered — and no more tears left to give.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Everyone thought she was fine.<br/>
She laughed, showed up, smiled.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">But no one saw the nights she didn’t sleep.<br/>
No one heard the screams she swallowed.</p>
   <p class="mb-4">Because the smile she wore...<br/>
was the one that lied.</p>
